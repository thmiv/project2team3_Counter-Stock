GO TEAM 3

Proposal:

Title: COUNTER STOCK
Members: Alejandro Gonzalez, Eric Galassi, Mommin Ahmad, Spencer Vigil, Thomas Milnes 

Quick Description: A multiplayer fight based RPG with attributes determined by real time stock prices.

Detailed Process (working):
    User creates a profile and picks from a list of stocks to fight with
    User is able to pick from a database of stocks with an initial value of $X
    Move to the "Fight" page to see the list of players and their $ value and name
    Player can choose from the list of players and decide to "fight" them
    Strength is based on the % change of their stock and a random multiplier
    $ value * random multiplier = strength
    Higher strength wins $100 of their own stock and lower strength loses $100 of their stock
    After being alerted and updated of the result player is back to fight page to choose next action
